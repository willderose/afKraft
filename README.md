# afKraft

Af Kraft is a crafting utility made mainly for personal use within FFXIV.

It allows a user to set up a list of actions to run in sequence as to allow for passive crafting.

A couple of dependencies need to be installed for it to properly work, if you wish to use it yourself:
- PySide (any version _should_ do, but this project was built with PySide6)
- pyautogui

Still very much a WIP, so broken functionalities are to be expected. A first release and its doc should be soon<sup>(tm)</sup>
